👋 Hello, it's me, @lawrence14701, your friendly neighborhood...Programmer. Ask me anything! Passionate about the environment, animals, and technology.

I have always been intrigued by the world of business and how humans can adapt, build, and even conquer the most difficult 
terrains and environments. Since the inception of the web a new frontier was born. As a pioneer, 
It is my duty to challenge myself every day to help humanity unlock its full potential....... hmmm maybe I've been watching too many episodes of Black Mirror.  
- 👀 I’m interested in working with startups scale and grow.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nestjs
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool projects, so reach out if you have a cool idea.
- 📫 How to reach me, email me at lawrence.nicastro1@gmail.com
